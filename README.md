# sql-express-practice

We'll be using the same databases from previous exercises to create API endpoints. We'll also be doing some work on different branches to help us practice git.

<!-- ## Round 1

For this round, you can stay here on the `main` branch

1. Create a GET endpoint that returns all Users
2. Create a GET endpoint that returns all Comments
3. Create a POST endpoint that allows you to create a User
4. Create a POST endpoint that allows you to create a Comment
5. Create a PUT endpoint that allows you to update a User
6. Create a PUT endpoint that allows you to update a Comment
7. Create a GET endpoint that allows you to retrieve a User's Comments -->

## Round 2

For this round, switch to the `apis/classroom` branch

<!-- 1. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Classes -->
<!-- 2. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Students -->
<!-- 3. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Teachers -->
<!-- 4. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Students given a specific Class ID -->
5. Create an endpoint to retrieve all Classes given a specific Teacher ID
6. Create an endpoint to retrieve a single Class given a specific ID
7. Create an endpoint to retrieve a single Student given a specific ID

#### Bonus

1. Modify your endpoint in Question 6 by also adding a list of Students that belong to the class in a `students` key 


## Round 3

For this round, switch to the `apis/food` branch

1. Create a full set of CRUD endpoints to 
   1. Create a specific item in the `food_des` table
   2. Read a specific item from the `food_des` table
   3. Update a specific item in the `food_des` table
   4. Delete a specific item in the `food_des` table
2. Create an endpoint to fetch all items in the `fd_group` table
3. Create an endpoint to fetch a single item in the `fd_group` given an `fdgrp_cd` 
4. Modify the endpoint in #3 to return a list of foods that belong to the food group
